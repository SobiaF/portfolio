	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I am a software developer with a deep passion for understanding how technology can help people and enable me to create amazing apps as well as software. I'm currently training at Mayden Academy while learning the following languages: HTML, CSS, Js and PHP. I'm on week 2 and can't wait to learn more.</p>	
	<p>When not coding my hobbies include sports such as basketball, bouldering and longboarding, photography, travelling, learning languages (mainly Korean) and exploring museums, caf√©s / restaurants, exhibitions with friends.</p>
